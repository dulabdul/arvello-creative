          <p>
            Thank you for trusting us with your digital needs and project
            development. We constantly strive to deliver the highest quality of
            work and are fully dedicated to the success of our clients'
            projects.
          </p>

          <h2>1. The Nature of Our Services</h2>
          <p>
            The services we offer involve custom digital products, interface
            design, website development, and software engineering. Because the
            nature of these services requires the immediate allocation of time,
            expert labor, and computing resources from the moment a project
            begins, the work performed cannot be "returned" in the way physical
            goods can.
          </p>

          <h2>2. No Refund Policy</h2>
          <p>
            For the reasons outlined above, we enforce a strict <strong
              >NO REFUND POLICY</strong
            > for all services, initial deposits (Down Payments), or full payments
            made to us.
          </p>
          <p>
            By accepting our proposal, agreeing to the Scope of Work, or making
            a payment, you fully understand and agree that the funds paid are
            non-refundable under any circumstances, including but not limited
            to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Change of mind or unilateral cancellation by the client.</li>
            <li>
              Changes in business direction, internal structure, or client
              strategy that render the project no longer necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
              Project delays or suspension caused by a lack of response,
              materials, content, or assets from the client.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Commitment to Revisions & Satisfaction</h2>
          <p>
            Although we do not offer refunds, we are deeply committed to your
            satisfaction. We provide structured revision cycles as agreed upon
            in our initial contract. If any deliverable does not meet the
            agreed-upon specifications, our team will make the necessary
            corrections at no additional cost, provided it does not deviate from
            the original Scope of Work.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Project Termination</h2>
          <p>
            If you decide to terminate a project before completion, you are not
            obligated to pay the remaining balance for future phases (provided
            work on those phases has not commenced). However, any initial
            deposit or payments made for ongoing or completed milestones are
            forfeited and cannot be reclaimed.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Help & Support</h2>
          <p>
            If you encounter any issues related to your project or have further
            questions regarding this policy, our team is always open to
            discussion to find the best possible win-win solution. Please reach
            out to us via our contact form or official email.
